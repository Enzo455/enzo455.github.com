<h1>The RMS. Titanic</h1>
<h2>Titanic-facts</h2>
<p>Titanic was one of the three Olympic type cruiser at the time, and it was made by White Star Line. It was made in Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Titanic had the capacity to hold about 3500 people. About 2600 passengers, 860 crew. Its first time on salty water was the 31st of May 1911.Its full speed was about 23 knots (42.5 km/h). Its height was 53 meters, width was 28 meters, and its length was 269 meters. </p>
<p>Titanic was a luxury ship that got the nickname «unsinkable». It was not. Because everyone thought RMS. Titanic was unsinkable, it had enough lifeboats for about half of the passengers on the ship. This caused half of the passengers on board to die. Titanic met its fate the 15th of April, after it sunk for about 2 hours. 1500 people did not make it home from Titanic’s unescapable faith. </p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Titanic was divided into three drastically different classes. Third class was the worst, second class was in the middle, and first class was the most luxurious you can ever think of. First and Third class are the most spoken of, and the second class is not to find in the movie Titanic (by James Cameron, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). Starting with third class, it was more luxurious than the standards of third class at the time, offering two meals each day in a dining room, even though at the time, third class passengers was obligated to bringing their own food to eat. </p>
<h4>Second class</h4>
<p> Second class on the RMS. Titanic was also more luxurious than its competitors, but there is not much to find regarding the second class. What there was to find though, is that there were several Public rooms for the passengers to enjoy. </p>
<h4>First class</h4>
<p>First class however, was a whole different story. If you have seen the movie Titanic, you probably have an idea of how luxurious first class on the RMS. Titanic truly was. For the men, they had halls for smoking cigars and drinking heavy alcohol heavy drinks, such as cognac. The women would enjoy eating in the very fancy restaurants on board, and drinking excellent wine from handpicked grapes from Italy, Spain and France. The cheapest first class fare for the RMS. Titanic would cost you £23 (approx. 2484£ in 2017 GBP.) without meals. A suite, however would cost you £400 (£43’200) for the cheapest, while a whopping £870 (£93’600) for the “Deluxe” accommodation. </p>
<h2>Passengers</h2>
<p>Titanic actually was heavily under capacitated for its first trip. It had the capacity to hold about 2’450 people, while it actually just held 1’317 passengers. 324 first class travellers, 284 second class travellers and 709 third class passengers. Of these, two thirds of the passengers were male, while one third was female. Titanic’s full capacity would be: 833 first class passengers, 614 second class passengers, and 1’006 third class travellers. The RMS. Titanic also carried many of the wealthiest people in the world, along with hundreds of immigrants from Ireland and the United Kingdom seeking a new life in North-America. </p>
